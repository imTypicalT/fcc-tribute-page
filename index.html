          <p id="pronunciation">" ka·puh·baa·ruh "</p>
          <ol>
            <li><span class="bold">Largest Rodent:</span> Capybaras are the largest rodents in the world. They can weigh up to 150 pounds (68 kg) and reach lengths of about 4 feet (1.2 meters).</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Semi-Aquatic Lifestyle:</span> Capybaras are semi-aquatic creatures. They are excellent swimmers and spend a lot of time in water, using it both as a means of escape from predators and as a way to regulate their body temperature.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Social Creatures:</span> Capybaras are highly social animals and are known to live in groups called "herds" or "troops." These groups can consist of up to 100 individuals, but usually, they are smaller, containing around 10-20 members.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Communication:</span> Capybaras communicate through a variety of vocalizations, including barks, whistles, and purrs. These sounds help them coordinate within their social groups and alert others to potential dangers.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Diet:</span> Capybaras are herbivores, primarily grazing on grasses and aquatic plants. Their unique digestive system allows them to efficiently extract nutrients from these fibrous plant materials.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Diverse Habitat:</span> Capybaras are native to South America and can be found in a variety of habitats such as grasslands, marshes, and rainforests, as well as near bodies of water like rivers, lakes, and ponds.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Strong Relationships:</span> Capybara groups often exhibit strong social bonds, and it's common to see them engaging in mutual grooming, which helps build and strengthen relationships within the group.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Parental Care:</span> Female capybaras give birth to relatively large litters of around 2 to 8 young, called pups. The entire group, including non-related individuals, helps care for and protect the pups.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Chewing Behavior:</span> Capybaras possess a unique chewing behavior known as "coprophagy," where they eat their own feces. This behavior aids in digestion by allowing them to extract more nutrients from their food.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Protected Status:</span> Capybaras are listed as "Least Concern" on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List due to their widespread distribution and stable population. However, habitat loss and hunting can still pose threats to their local populations.</li>
